# IOT_Project_LDR_PIR
This project simulates a smart home automation system using an ESP32 microcontroller that:
.Continuously detects human presence using a PIR sensor
.Monitors ambient light using an LDR sensor
.Automatically turns on a light when motion is detected in low-light conditions
.Sends real-time alerts to the cloud when someone is detected in a dark environment
